# Config Folder

Here’s where we keep the game’s brainy settings—balance tweaks, initial game data,and traduccion and all those numbers that make the game feel just right. 

- **JSON/YAML files**: Adjust stats, item prices, starting resources, and more.
- **Settings**: Include user preferences like difficulty, audio levels, and keybindings.

If you’re testing changes, back up your files first. A misplaced comma can ruin your day.
