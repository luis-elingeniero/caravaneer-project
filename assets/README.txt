# Assets Folder

This is where all the game's pretty (or not-so-pretty) visuals, sounds, and fonts live. If it makes the game look or sound like something, itâ€™s probably in here. Here's the breakdown:

- **sprites/**: All 2D graphics like character portraits, items, terrain, and interface icons. 
    *Don't replace anything randomly!* Use consistent formats (preferably PNG).
- **audio/**: Sound effects, ambient tracks, and music. File size matters, so avoid uploading a 10-minute opera.
- **fonts/**: Fonts used in the game menus and UI. 
    *Tip*: Ensure licensing if you add new ones.
- **default/**: Default resources for when the game can't find something. 
    Examples: a generic "missing texture" image or "error" beep sound. 
    *Critical for avoiding crashes!*

Keep things organized. If you add something new, double-check scripts reference it correctly.
