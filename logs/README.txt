# Logs Folder

Debugging? Look here. This folder stores crash reports, error logs, and anything else the game spits out when it’s unhappy. 

- **error.log**: Details about crashes and missing files. 
- **debug.log**: Extra info for developers. Can be verbose—don’t let it fill up your hard drive.

When debugging, remember: logs are your friend. Check them before assuming the game hates you.
