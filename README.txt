Welcome to the Caravaneer Port Project!
Hi there!

I'm Luis, "the engineer" who decided to take on this crazy idea of porting a 10+ year-old Flash game to a more modern (and flexible) game engine. Right now, this is an unofficial project—I haven’t asked Dmitry Zheltobriukhov (the original creator) for permission yet, so yes, I’ve "borrowed" the assets from the SWF file (sorry!).

Honestly, I’m not sure if I’ll finish this or if anyone else will even care, but here I am with some free time and a desire to learn. A quick note: I’m a native Spanish speaker, not fluent in English, so feel free to correct me if you spot mistakes. Also, I’m a mechanic by trade—not a programmer or developer—so if you find errors, you’re welcome to point them out with full authority.

What is this project?
This is essentially my little "toy project" to learn Godot while paying homage to a nostalgic game that holds a special place in my heart. I can’t promise to recreate the entire game, though I might get there someday. The goal is to rebuild the core functionality of Caravaneer 2 in a way that’s editable and modifiable—unlike the original SWF, where even small changes are a headache.

In the future, I might try reaching out to Dmitry to ask how he built the game and its concepts, because I genuinely respect his work. I don’t want to steal his creation (despite using his assets here—again, sorry!), and I’m aware the game was community-funded and sold on Steam. So, this is not abandonware—it’s just a tribute.

My main objective is to lay a foundation for others in the community to expand upon. Whether it’s a straight-up "port" of the original or a "Caravaneer 2.5" with additional features, I hope this project can support mods, and maybe even run on mobile someday.

What’s the plan?
Recreate the foundation: Focus on the basic systems of the game, such as trade mechanics, combat, and exploration, in Godot.
Enable modding: Make the game flexible enough that future modders can easily add or change elements without breaking the game.
For example, I’d like to avoid situations where a mods adds a new weapon and crash the game
Document everything: Leave text files in the folders as guides. They might not teach much, but they’ll at least prevent things from being
misplaced and give a glimpse into the project’s internal logic.
Pay tribute to the original: I want to stay faithful to the style and lore of the game, but with room for extra features.
Some ideas include adding more backstories, like starting as a pirate kicked out of their group, a fugitive slave, or just an ambitious wanderer with little to lose.
Future Goals (If Time Permits):
Revamp the workshop: It’s currently underutilized, mostly for Molotovs and minor weapon tweaks. This could be expanded.
Reach out to Dmitry: Ask for his blessing (and maybe insights into the art style and lore).
Caravaneer 2.5 vision: Build upon the foundation to include features requested by the community.
Acknowledgments
A large part of the project's organization and structure wouldn’t have been possible without ChatGPT (seriously). It’s been invaluable in making sure this doesn’t end up like the original SWF—impossible to edit without tearing everything apart.

This is just a tribute, and while I can’t guarantee I’ll finish it, I hope it can inspire others in the community to continue the journey. If you’d like to contribute, correct me, or just share your ideas, you’re more than welcome to join. Let’s keep the caravan moving!
