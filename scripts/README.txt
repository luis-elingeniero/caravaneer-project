Here lies the code that keeps everything running. We’ve split it up into sections to keep our sanity intact (hopefully). 

- core The universal rules of the game—player stats, inventory management, saveload systems, etc. Tread carefully; this is like the spinal cord.
- ui Handles all the menus, popups, and HUD elements. If buttons stop working, look here.
- gameplay Specific mechanics like combat, economy, and crafting. Expand this as you add new features.
- utils Reusable functions and tools. Examples math functions, debugging utilities, or procedural generators.

Keep functions modular and well-commented. It’s not just for others—future-you will thank you!
